# Hi, I'm Jonathan Marcu üëã

I‚Äôm a data scientist and machine learning enthusiast with a passion for solving real-world problems using data and AI. I have successfully completed a program at MIT called Data Science and Machine Learning, and I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I have a strong background in data analysis and reporting, inventory management, process optimization, and sales performance improvement, gained from my 16-year career at Costco Wholesale, where I held various roles such as department lead merchandiser, forklift driver, inventory specialist, and product sales. I‚Äôm currently seeking a new opportunity in the tech/data industry, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to create value and impact.

## üëÄ What I'm interested in

I‚Äôm interested in learning how to apply data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems in various domains. I love to work with different types of data, such as text, images, and numbers, and use various tools and techniques, such as Python, SQL, Tableau, and Scikit-learn, to analyze, visualize, and model data. I also enjoy reading, writing, and learning from online courses, blogs, and podcasts about data science and machine learning.

## üå± What I'm currently learning

I‚Äôm currently expanding my knowledge of data science and machine learning, such as data analysis, visualization, statistics, regression, clustering, and classification. I‚Äôm also learning how to use Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and other popular tools and libraries for data science and machine learning. I‚Äôm always curious and eager to learn new things and improve my skills as a data scientist.

## üíûÔ∏è What I'm looking to collaborate on

I'm looking to collaborate on any data science or machine learning projects that are related to my interests or skills. I'm also open to collaborating on research papers, blog posts, or tutorials that can share my knowledge and experience with others. I'm always eager to meet new people and learn from them.

## ‚ö° Fun fact

I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, two daughters, and two dogs) and doing various activities with them. Some of my hobbies and interests are golf, skateboarding, snowboarding, basketball, soccer, Lego, CAD, coding and video games.

![](https://d9jmtjs5r4cgq.cloudfront.net/CertificateAndTranscript/102980/original/JONATHAN_MARCU_certificate20240123-949-1cbxd4k.jpg)
This is a course that I took from September 2023 to January 2024 at MIT. It covers the foundations of data science and machine learning, such as data analysis, visualization, statistics, hypothesis testing, regression, clustering, classification, ensemble learning, recommendation systems, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. You can find more details about the course and my certificate at this link.

### Course Projects

As part of the course, I completed several projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in data science and machine learning. Here are some of the projects that I'm most proud of:

- **Shinkansen Bullet Train Passenger Satisfaction Prediction** (January 2024): This project involves predicting whether passengers who travelled on the Shinkansen Bullet Train in Japan were satisfied with their overall travel experience or not, based on various parameters such as on-time performance, seat comfort, food quality, etc. I used a combination of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and machine learning models to analyze the data from the travel and survey reports and identify the most important factors that influence passenger satisfaction. I achieved a 94.35% accuracy rating on the test data, which was among the top scores in the Hackathon.

  Skills & Tools Covered: Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, KerasClassifier, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost

- **Building a recommendation system to recommend the best Amazon products to users** (January 2024): This project involves recommending the best Amazon products available to users based on past rating data using recommendation systems techniques. I used rank-based, similarity-based, and matrix factorization based methods to generate personalized recommendations for different users. I also evaluated the performance of the different methods using metrics such as precision, recall, and RMSE.

  Skills & Tools Covered: Rank-based Recommendation Systems, Similarity-based Recommendation Systems, Matrix Factorization based Recommendation Systems, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise

- **Predicting Potential Customers** (December 2023): This project involves identifying which leads are more likely to convert to paid customers based on attributes of leads and their interaction details. I used decision trees, random forests, and hyperparameter tuning to build and optimize a classification model that can predict the probability of conversion for each lead. I also performed hypothesis testing to compare the conversion rates of different groups of leads.

  Skills & Tools Covered: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Hyperparameter Tuning, Hypothesis Testing, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Statsmodels

- **FoodHub Order Analysis** (October 2023): This project involves analyzing the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help the company to enhance business and customer experience. I used exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and statistics to answer various business questions, such as which restaurants are the most popular, which cuisines are the most preferred, which days and times have the highest demand, etc.

  Skills & Tools Covered: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Statistics, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
