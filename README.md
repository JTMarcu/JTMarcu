# Hi, I'm Jonathan Marcu üëã

I‚Äôm a data scientist and machine learning enthusiast with a passion for solving real-world problems using data and AI. I have successfully completed a program at MIT called Data Science and Machine Learning, and I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

I have a strong background in data analysis and reporting, inventory management, process optimization, and sales performance improvement, gained from my 16-year career at Costco Wholesale. During my time there, I held various roles such as department lead merchandiser, forklift driver, inventory specialist, and product sales.

Recently, I've been delving into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and prompt engineering with AI models. To stay ahead in tech, I'm developing chatbots and offering my data analytics and business intelligence skills as a freelancer to support small businesses and entrepreneurs. Additionally, I'm exploring predictive modeling for stock market analysis to keep my projects diverse and engaging.


I‚Äôm currently seeking a new opportunity in the tech/data industry, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to create value and impact.

I‚Äôm currently expanding my knowledge of data science and machine learning, such as data analysis, visualization, statistics, regression, clustering, and classification. I‚Äôm also learning how to use Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and other popular tools and libraries for data science and machine learning. Recently, I've been delving into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and prompt engineering with AI models. To stay ahead in tech, I'm developing chatbots and offering my data analytics and business intelligence skills as a freelancer to support small businesses and entrepreneurs. Additionally, I'm exploring predictive modeling for stock market analysis to keep my projects diverse and engaging. On top of that, I'm learning Flask and Django to build a portfolio of my work, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic web applications. I'm also diving into understanding the uses and strengths of GitHub to manage and showcase my projects effectively.


## üíûÔ∏è What I'm looking to collaborate on

I'm looking to collaborate on any data science or machine learning projects that align with my interests or skills. I'm also open to collaborating on research papers, blog posts, or tutorials to share my knowledge and experience with others. I'm always eager to meet new people and learn from them.

## ‚ö° Fun fact

I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, two daughters, and two dogs) and doing various activities with them. Some of my hobbies and interests are golf, skateboarding, snowboarding, basketball, soccer, Lego, CAD, coding, and video games.

## üéì MIT - Data Science and Machine Learning: Making Data-Driven Decisions

![MIT Certificate](https://d9jmtjs5r4cgq.cloudfront.net/CertificateAndTranscript/102980/original/JONATHAN_MARCU_certificate20240123-949-1cbxd4k.jpg)

This is a course that I took from September 2023 to January 2024 at MIT. It covers the foundations of data science and machine learning, such as data analysis, visualization, statistics, hypothesis testing, regression, clustering, classification, ensemble learning, recommendation systems, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. You can find more details about the course and my certificate at this link.

### Course Projects

As part of the course, I completed several projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in data science and machine learning. Here are some of the projects that I'm most proud of:

- **Shinkansen Bullet Train Passenger Satisfaction Prediction** (January 2024): This project involves predicting whether passengers who traveled on the Shinkansen Bullet Train in Japan were satisfied with their overall travel experience based on various parameters such as on-time performance, seat comfort, and food quality. I used a combination of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and machine learning models to analyze the data from the travel and survey reports and identify the most important factors that influence passenger satisfaction. I achieved a 94.35% accuracy rating on the test data, which was among the top scores in the Hackathon.
  
  Skills & Tools Covered: Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, KerasClassifier, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost.

- **Building a Recommendation System to Recommend the Best Amazon Products to Users** (January 2024): This project involves recommending the best Amazon products available to users based on past rating data using recommendation systems techniques. I used rank-based, similarity-based, and matrix factorization methods to generate personalized recommendations for different users. I also evaluated the performance of the different methods using metrics such as precision, recall, and RMSE.
  
  Skills & Tools Covered: Rank-based Recommendation Systems, Similarity-based Recommendation Systems, Matrix Factorization, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise.

- **Predicting Potential Customers** (December 2023): This project involves identifying which leads are more likely to convert to paid customers based on attributes of leads and their interaction details. I used decision trees, random forests, and hyperparameter tuning to build and optimize a classification model that can predict the probability of conversion for each lead. I also performed hypothesis testing to compare the conversion rates of different groups of leads.
  
  Skills & Tools Covered: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Hyperparameter Tuning, Hypothesis Testing, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Statsmodels.

- **FoodHub Order Analysis** (October 2023): This project involves analyzing the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants, which will help the company to enhance business and customer experience. I used exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and statistics to answer various business questions, such as which restaurants are the most popular, which cuisines are the most preferred, which days and times have the highest demand, etc.
  
  Skills & Tools Covered: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Statistics, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Google Data Analytics Professional Certification

- **[BellaBeat Capstone Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonmarcu/bellabeat-analysis)** (March 2024): The capstone project analyzed user data from a fitness tracker to understand activity levels, sleep patterns, and heart rate variability, revealing correlations between physical activity and health metrics. It highlighted the importance of high-intensity activities for caloric burn, the role of adequate sleep in reducing sedentary behavior, and the need for balancing calorie intake with expenditure. The findings suggest that personalized activity goals and improved tracking can promote healthier lifestyles among users.
